# Chat App

Back then, distance was a hindrance in communication, message could take days, even weeks just to be delivered. With nowadays internet, message only needs a fraction of second to be replied, making people connect without any borders. Chat App is a realtime messaging application made of MEVN (MySQL, ExpressJs, VueJS, NodeJS) tech stack. It is powered by Socket.io to enable realtime data transfer. User just need to register, find their friends, and chat with each other
